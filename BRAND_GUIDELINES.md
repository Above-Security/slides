# Above Brand Guidelines

These guidelines adapt Square's brand system for the Above project. Fonts come from Square Sans Display and Square Sans Text served via Square's CDN. Colors use Market Blue `#006DFF` and Racer Yellow `#EDFF80` plus a gray palette.

> Market Blue is used as an accent color for moments that warrant care between Square and the end user, such as action moments on public web.

> Our logo can be used only in black or white to ensure brand consistency and legibility.

Use concise, friendly language and simple iconography. The provided logo SVG remains unchanged.
