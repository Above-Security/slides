4. Navigates to /slides/slide/1 ✅
5. EmailGate appears ✅
6. After email: sees slides ✅
```

#### **Scenario 2: Direct Slides Access**
```
1. User visits /slides/ ✅
2. Redirects to /slides/slide/1 ✅
3. EmailGate appears immediately ✅
4. After email: slide navigation works ✅
5. Can return to homepage via browser back ✅
```

#### **Scenario 3: Direct URL Sharing**
```

## ⚠️ **Issue Resolution Log**

### **Issues Encountered & Resolved**

#### **Issue 1: Router Base Path Confusion**
- **Problem**: Initial confusion about Vite base URL vs Router basename
- **Solution**: Properly configured `basename="/slides"` in Router
- **Result**: URLs work correctly with GitHub Pages setup ✅

#### **Issue 2: EmailGate State Management**
- **Problem**: Ensuring EmailGate only appears for slides, not homepage
- **Solution**: Clean component separation - EmailGate only in PresentationApp
- **Result**: Homepage standalone, slides gated ✅

#### **Issue 3: Navigation Link Targeting**
- **Problem**: Homepage "View Presentation" button targeting wrong route
- **Solution**: Updated to use correct `/slide/1` path
- **Result**: Navigation works seamlessly ✅
