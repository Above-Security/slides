# Above Security Use Cases

## Coverage Across Full Insider Risk Spectrum

Above addresses all stages of insider behavior — negligence, malice, and compromise — without reliance on predefined apps or static policy rules.

### Negligent Behaviors
- Excessive personal use during work hours
- Downloading unauthorized or risky software
- Authorizing unsanctioned third-party applications
- Sharing floating or shared credentials
- Falling for advanced phishing that bypasses traditional defenses (e.g., phishing hosted on trusted services)

### Malicious Actions
- Payroll staff accessing sales or deal data — cross-role access anomalies
- Data staging or hoarding pre-departure
- Circumventing monitoring and logging controls

### Security Gaps
- OAuth misuse through over-permissioned consents
- Operating without MFA on sensitive systems
- Inappropriate or high-risk web browsing activity
- Shadow AI tools circumventing approved workflows

## Real-World Examples from Your Information

### Example 1: Cross-Role Access Detection
**Scenario**: "Payroll employee accessing the PII database at 2 AM triggers investigation."
