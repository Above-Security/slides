# How Above Works

## No Agents. No Integrations. No Waiting.

While legacy tools stop at login or depend on stitched logs, Above shows what users are actually doing — in the browser, in real time.

## Core Technology: LLM-Based Semantic Analysis

Powered by **LLM-based semantic analysis**, Above understands **intent**, not just activity — flagging threats like Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, and AI misuse *as they happen*, even inside homegrown tools.

## Key Capabilities

### Real-Time Visibility
Above gives security teams full session context and lets them **nudge users in the moment** to change behavior before it becomes risk.

### Built-In Compliance Support
With built-in support for MFA hygiene, audit-ready logging (HIPAA, ISO, PCI), and visibility across every app, Above closes the critical gap between access and action — where most insider threats begin.
