# Above Platform Capabilities

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Runtime Behavioral Intelligence

Above's behavioral intelligence engine provides unprecedented visibility into user actions:

#### Real-Time Detection
- **In-Session Monitoring**: Captures user behavior as it happens, not hours later
- **Intent Analysis**: AI-powered modeling flags anomalies based on context
- **Behavioral Drift Detection**: Identifies deviations from normal patterns
- **Full Journey Capture**: Complete session-level forensics with replay capability

#### Semantic Understanding
- **LLM-Based Analysis**: Native understanding of page content and user actions
- **Application Agnostic**: Works with any web application without configuration
- **Context-Aware**: Understands the difference between research and exfiltration
- **Dynamic Learning**: Adapts to new applications and workflows automatically

**Example Use Case**: *A payroll employee accessing the customer database at 2 AM triggers an investigation — not because of the time, but because payroll staff never access customer data.*

### 2. Intelligent Real-Time Intervention

Above doesn't just detect — it prevents:

#### Nudge System
- **Contextual Warnings**: Pop-ups that explain risk in the moment
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Guides users to approved tools
- **Educational Content**: In-context training reduces repeat violations
- **Escalation Paths**: From gentle reminder to session termination

#### Intervention Types
- **Soft Nudge**: "This looks like customer data — remember to use the secure portal"
- **Confirmation Request**: "This seems unusual — are you working on the Q4 report?"
- **Hard Block**: "This action violates policy and has been prevented"
- **Session Termination**: Immediate disconnect for critical violations

### 3. Complete Application Discovery

#### Shadow IT Detection
- **Unknown SaaS Discovery**: Finds all cloud applications in use
- **Browser Extension Analysis**: Flags risky or unauthorized plugins
- **AI Tool Detection**: Identifies ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs
- **Custom App Support**: Works with internal and homegrown applications

#### OAuth Permission Analysis
- **Scope Assessment**: Semantic understanding of granted permissions
- **Risk Scoring**: Evaluates potential for data access abuse
- **Consent Tracking**: Full audit trail of authorization events
- **Revocation Automation**: Programmatic removal of risky permissions

**Example**: *Finance team found using unauthorized AI assistant for sensitive data processing, with automatic nudge to use approved alternative.*

### 4. Automated Compliance & Forensics

#### Audit-Ready Logging
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS support
- **Instant Reports**: One-click compliance documentation
- **Full Reconstruction**: Complete user session replay
- **Evidence Package**: Court-admissible documentation

#### Policy Enforcement
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notification of violations
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger responses based on risk level
- **Custom Rules**: Flexible policy engine for unique requirements
- **Zero-Touch Operation**: No manual configuration needed
