## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Creating a New Component
1. Follow the component structure in [Development Guidelines](./03-development-guidelines.md#react-components)
2. Use design tokens from [Design System](./01-design-system.md#design-tokens)
3. Apply patterns from [Best Practices](./04-best-practices.md#component-patterns)
4. Add to component library documentation

### Using Glass Effects
```jsx
import GlassPanel from '@/components/primitives/GlassPanel';

<GlassPanel variant="strong" className="p-6 rounded-xl">
  Your content here
</GlassPanel>
```

### Adding Animations
```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.4 }}
>
  Animated content
</motion.div>
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Through Hierarchy
Information architecture that guides users naturally through content.

### 2. Subtle Sophistication
Effects and animations that enhance understanding without distraction.

### 3. Contextual Awareness
Components that adapt intelligently to their environment and user needs.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Design System
├── Tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
├── Primitives (basic building blocks)
├── Components (composed UI elements)
└── Patterns (reusable solutions)
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Glass Morphism
Our signature visual style combining transparency, blur, and subtle borders for depth and sophistication.

### Motion System
Purposeful animations that:
- Guide attention
- Provide feedback
- Create spatial relationships
- Enhance perceived performance

### Responsive Design
Mobile-first approach with consistent scaling and adaptation across all device sizes.

### Accessibility First
WCAG AA compliant with:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Reduced motion options
- High contrast compatibility

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### Recommended Extensions
- **ESLint** - Code quality
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** - Class name completion
- **React Developer Tools** - Component debugging

### Useful Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run lint       # Check code quality
npm run test       # Run tests
```
