# Above Security

**See intent. Stop risk. Right now.**
Above gives organizations real-time intelligence on user intent and risky behavior — so they can coach good people before they make mistakes, catch bad actors before data walks out the door, and hand off clear evidence when it matters.

---

## What is Above?

**Above** is an endpoint-native insider protection platform that shows what users actually do *inside apps* — across SaaS, internal, and custom apps — and intervenes in the moment to prevent data loss and misuse. Powered by **LLM-based semantic analysis**, Above understands **intent**, not just clicks, and nudges users in-session to change outcomes without blocking.

**No agents. No integrations. No waiting.**

---

## Assess Risk

**Quantify intent risk with full session context.**
Above captures live user activity and business context to surface who’s at risk, why, and where to act first.

* Dynamic intent-risk scoring from real session behavior
* Cohort views by team, role, and pattern
* Drill-down timelines that explain *what happened and why*

---

## Shape Behavior

**Change outcomes in the moment.**
Coach users exactly when risk appears — right in their workflow.

* Real-time, in-session nudges before risky actions complete
* Playbooks for Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, AI misuse, exfiltration, and phishing
* Precision guidance that reduces friction without heavy-handed blocks

---

## Ensure Compliance

**Prove control with audit-ready evidence.**
Turn live session intelligence into clear, defensible records.

* Full session reconstruction and immutable logs
* MFA hygiene checks and policy alignment (HIPAA, ISO, PCI)
* Evidence packs your auditors, HR & investigators — can trust

---

## How It Works

**See** — Capture live session behavior in the browser across SaaS and custom apps.
**Understand** — LLMs separate normal work from risky intent (Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, AI misuse, exfiltration, phishing).
**Guide** — Real-time nudges change behavior without blocking or breaking flow.
**Prove** — Audit-ready logs and replay for HIPAA, ISO, PCI — with clear, actionable evidence.

---

## Why Above

Traditional tools stop at authentication or stitched logs. Above protects the gap **between access and action** — where insider risk actually happens — with the context, precision, and speed only a true endpoint-level sensor can deliver.

---

## Outcomes

* Fewer incidents because risky actions are coached away in real time
* Faster investigations with complete session evidence
* Less noise than logs, less friction than blocking — and measurable behavior change

---

## Built for Security Teams

* **CISOs** — Prove control over insider risk without crushing productivity
* **SecOps & IR** — See what happened, when, and why — instantly
* **Compliance** — Turn real-time behavior guidance into audit-ready records

---

## Where It Helps (Right Away)

* **Data Loss & Exfiltration** — Risky downloads, pastes, uploads, and shares detected in context
* **Shadow SaaS & OAuth Abuse** — Unsanctioned apps and risky grants surfaced as they occur
* **AI & Policy Misuse** — Sensitive prompts and outputs caught before they leave the org
* **Sophisticated Phishing** — Detect credential harvesting, payload delivery, and social-engineering pages in real time using LLM-based page inspection
* **LOTS Phishing (Living Off Trusted Services)** — Catch phishing hosted on legitimate platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft 365, etc.) by analyzing page content and behavior, not just domains
* **MFA Hygiene & Session Integrity** — Weak factors and suspicious session patterns identified early

---

## Deployment & Privacy

* **Invisible rollout** — Works from the browser without agents or complex integrations
* **Broad coverage** — SaaS, internal, and custom apps — including homegrown tools
* **Privacy by design** — Policy-aware capture, least-privilege access, and redaction safeguards

## Features

- Excessive personal use during work hours
- Downloading unauthorized or risky software
- Authorizing unsanctioned third-party applications
- Sharing floating or shared credentials
- Falling for advanced phishing that bypasses traditional defenses (e.g., phishing hosted on trusted services — LOTS)
- Authorizing OAuth misuse through over-permissioned consents
- Payroll staff accessing sales or deal data — cross-role access anomalies
- Operating without MFA on sensitive systems
- Inappropriate or high-risk web browsing activity
- Shadow AI tools circumventing approved workflows
- Data staging or hoarding pre-departure
- Circumventing monitoring and logging controls
