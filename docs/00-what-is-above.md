# What is Above Security?

**Above gives organizations real-time intelligence on user intent and risky behavior — so they can coach good people before they make mistakes, catch bad actors before data walks out the door, and hand off clear evidence when it matters.**

## Overview

**Above** is a real-time insider protection platform that gives security teams visibility into user behavior — and a way to guide it. It detects risky activity *after login* across SaaS, internal, and custom apps, helping prevent phishing, misuse, and data loss — without relying on blocking or heavy-handed controls.

Powered by **LLM-based semantic analysis**, Above understands **intent**, not just activity — flagging threats like Shadow SaaS, OAuth abuse, and AI misuse *as they happen*, even inside homegrown tools.

## Key Differentiators

### No agents. No integrations. No waiting.

While legacy tools stop at login or depend on stitched logs, Above shows what users are actually doing — in the browser, in real time. It gives security teams full session context and lets them **nudge users in the moment** to change behavior before it becomes risk.

With built-in support for MFA hygiene, audit-ready logging (HIPAA, ISO, PCI), and visibility across every app, Above closes the critical gap between access and action — where most insider threats begin.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional security tools miss the critical gap between authentication and action. They can tell you:
- WHO logged in
- WHAT systems they accessed
- WHEN they connected

But they can't tell you:
- WHAT users actually did inside applications
- WHY their behavior might be risky
- HOW to intervene before damage occurs

**Above is the only security platform that understands what users actually do inside applications — not just which apps they access.**

## Our Approach: Behavioral Intelligence

Above takes a fundamentally different approach to insider risk:

1. **See Everything**: Full visibility into user sessions across all applications
2. **Understand Intent**: LLM-powered analysis that distinguishes between normal work and risky behavior
3. **Guide Behavior**: Real-time nudges that coach users away from risky actions
4. **Prove Compliance**: Audit-ready logs with full session reconstruction

## Why This Matters Now

The insider threat landscape has fundamentally changed:

- **Remote Work**: Distributed teams mean less visibility and more risk surfaces
- **SaaS Explosion**: Average enterprise uses 130+ SaaS apps, each a potential data leak vector
- **AI Tools**: Shadow AI usage creates new compliance and data exposure risks
- **Sophisticated Attacks**: Phishing and social engineering bypass traditional perimeter defenses
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Stricter compliance requirements demand provable controls

Above addresses these challenges with a platform built for the modern threat landscape — where the biggest risks come from inside, not outside.
