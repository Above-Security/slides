# The Insider Threat Landscape (2025)

## The Stats That Matter

The insider threat problem has reached critical mass, with organizations facing unprecedented risk from within:

### Financial Impact
- **$17.4M**: Average annual cost of insider threats (Ponemon Institute)
- **Up 31%**: Increase in insider threat costs over the past two years
- **$756,760**: Average cost per incident for negligent insiders
- **$648,845**: Average cost per incident for malicious insiders

### Incident Volume & Response
- **7,868**: Insider incidents in 2025 (up from 3,269 in 2018)
- **81 days**: Median time to contain an insider incident
- **26%**: Incidents that take more than 90 days to contain
- **12%**: Organizations that detect insider threats in less than a week

### Threat Breakdown
- **55%**: Negligent employees or contractors
- **25%**: Malicious insiders
- **20%**: Credential theft/compromise

### Organizational Response
- **81%**: Organizations have or plan to implement insider risk programs
- **16.5%**: Security budget now allocated to insider risk (up from 8.2% in 2023)
- **65%**: Say insider risk is the only strategy for pre-breach protection
- **63%**: Report faster response due to IRM investment

## Common Insider Threat Vectors

### 1. Negligent Behavior (55% of incidents)
- Excessive personal use during work hours
- Downloading unauthorized or risky software
- Sharing floating or shared credentials
- Inappropriate or high-risk web browsing activity
- Falling for phishing that bypasses traditional defenses

### 2. Malicious Actions (25% of incidents)
- Data staging or hoarding pre-departure
- Cross-role access anomalies (e.g., payroll accessing sales data)
- Circumventing monitoring and logging controls
- Intellectual property theft
- Competitive intelligence gathering

### 3. Compromised Credentials (20% of incidents)
- Advanced phishing hosted on trusted services
- OAuth misuse through over-permissioned consents
- Account takeover through session hijacking
- Lateral movement post-compromise

## The Evolution of Insider Threats

### Traditional Threats (Pre-2020)
- USB drive data exfiltration
- Email forwarding to personal accounts
- Printing sensitive documents
- Database dumps

### Modern Threats (2020-2025)
- **Shadow IT/SaaS**: 1,000+ apps per enterprise, most unmanaged
- **Shadow AI**: ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs processing sensitive data
- **OAuth Abuse**: Over-permissioned third-party app connections
- **Browser-Based Attacks**: Phishing sites on legitimate platforms
- **Supply Chain Insider Risk**: Contractors and third-party access

### Emerging Threats (2025+)
- **AI-Assisted Social Engineering**: Deepfakes and synthetic identities
- **Automated Data Harvesting**: Bots mimicking human behavior
- **Cross-Platform Data Aggregation**: Combining data from multiple SaaS apps
- **Behavioral Manipulation**: Exploiting psychological patterns at scale

## Why Traditional Tools Fail

### The Visibility Gap
Traditional security tools operate at the wrong layer:

1. **CASB/SIEM**: See traffic and logs, not user behavior
2. **DLP**: Catches files in motion, misses context
3. **EDR**: Focuses on endpoints, blind to SaaS activity
4. **IAM**: Stops at authentication, misses post-login actions

### The Context Problem
Without behavioral context, security teams face:
- **99% false positives**: Legitimate work looks like data theft
- **Alert fatigue**: Thousands of meaningless alerts daily
- **Reactive stance**: Detection after damage is done
- **Compliance gaps**: Can't prove what users actually did

### The Speed Challenge
Modern insider threats happen in real-time:
- **Seconds**: To copy customer database to personal storage
- **Minutes**: To authorize malicious OAuth app
- **Hours**: To exfiltrate IP through approved channels

Traditional tools with daily log analysis and manual review can't keep pace.

## The Above Advantage

Above addresses these challenges through:

1. **Real-Time Visibility**: See user actions as they happen
2. **Behavioral Intelligence**: Understand intent, not just activity
3. **Instant Intervention**: Guide users before damage occurs
4. **Complete Coverage**: Every app, every session, every action

This approach transforms insider risk from a detection problem to a prevention opportunity â€” protecting both the organization and its people.
