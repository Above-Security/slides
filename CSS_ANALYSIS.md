# CSS Refactoring Analysis - What Went Wrong

## Problem Identified:
The CSS refactoring completely broke the visual design because:

1. **Missing Slide-Specific Styles**: I extracted slide-specific CSS to `.module.css` files but the React components are NOT importing these modules
2. **Incomplete Extraction**: Many critical styles were left in the original App.css and then removed without being properly moved
3. **CSS Modules Not Implemented**: Created `.module.css` files but didn't update the JSX components to use them
4. **Missing Card Styles**: The key-point-card, landscape-card, and other critical component styles are missing

## What the Working Version Has:
- Beautiful styled cards with hover effects
- Proper spacing and layout
- Gradient backgrounds and animations
- Styled icons and typography
- Executive summary dark section

## What the Broken Version Shows:
- Plain unstyled cards (no background, borders, or styling)
- Missing hover effects
- No proper spacing
- Missing the executive summary styling
- Broken layout structure

## Root Cause:
I created a modular structure but failed to:
1. Import the CSS modules in the React components
2. Ensure all styles were properly migrated
3. Test thoroughly before committing

## Fix Strategy:
1. Restore all missing styles to the main CSS files
2. Keep the modular structure but ensure everything works
3. Properly implement CSS modules if needed
4. Test every visual element before committing
