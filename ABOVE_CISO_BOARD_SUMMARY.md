## 🧭 Positioning & Messaging

### ✅ What Resonated
- **“Insider Risk”** or **“Insider Protection”** were preferred terms over "threat detection".
- The idea of **visibility after login** filled a clear blind spot in existing tools.
- **Real-time SaaS & browser visibility** was seen as unique and necessary.

### ⚠️ What to Avoid
- Avoid "browser security" — misleads to endpoint or network tooling categories.
- Avoid "phishing protection" — makes buyers think of email security.
- Avoid heavy jargon like “ITDR” — not meaningful to most CISOs.

## 🎯 Core Use Cases that Mattered

1. **OAuth Abuse & Risky App Authorizations**
   - CISOs want visibility into what third-party apps users are connecting.
2. **Offboarding Drift**
   - Open sessions post-departure are a major concern.
3. **Shadow AI & SaaS Usage**
   - Copy-pasting into ChatGPT or using Grammarly with sensitive data.
4. **Session Timelines for Incident Investigations**
   - Above’s value in **reconstructing user behavior** was strongly validated.

## 💡 Feature & Product Takeaways

### 🔍 Must-Have Capabilities
- **Real-time user behavior visibility** in SaaS/browsers
- **Post-incident timelines** with contextual evidence

### 🤝 Insider Protection > Insider Threat
- Shift narrative toward **helping employees avoid mistakes**.
- Emphasize **early signals** over reactive enforcement.

## 📊 Buying Criteria & Strategic Themes

### 🔄 Consolidation
- Buyers are actively seeking to **replace 2–3 tools** with 1.
- Above could **displace portions of DLP, SSPM, UEBA**, etc.

### 🧠 Intent Matters (but it's HR’s job)
- CISOs care more about **facts + context** than automated “intent engines.”
- Tools must **support HR/legal handoff**, not act as judge.
