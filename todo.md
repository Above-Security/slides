# CSS Refactoring Todo

## Phase 1: Repository setup and CSS analysis ✅
- [x] Clone repository and analyze structure
- [x] Identify CSS file size (2845 lines) and major sections
- [x] Map out current architecture and dependencies

## Phase 2: Propose initial refactoring strategy ✅
- [x] Analyze CSS sections and categorize by functionality
- [x] Create proposed directory structure
- [x] Define first incremental step for extraction
- [x] Document rationale for each organizational decision

## Phase 3: Implement first modular extraction step ✅
- [x] Extract base styles (reset, typography, variables)
- [x] Create initial directory structure
- [x] Update imports in main App.css
- [x] Ensure no functionality is broken

## Phase 4: Validate and test first step ✅
- [x] Test build process with Vite
- [x] Verify all styles are loading correctly
- [x] Check for any missing imports or broken styles

## Phase 5: Continue incremental refactoring
- [ ] Extract layout components (presentation controls, containers)

- [ ] Co-locate slide-specific CSS with slide components
- [ ] Extract utility classes and animations

## Phase 6: Final validation and delivery
- [ ] Complete build testing
- [ ] Document the new structure
- [ ] Provide migration guide
- [ ] Deliver refactored codebase
