# CSS Refactoring Todo

## Phase 1: Repository setup and CSS analysis ✅
- [x] Clone repository and analyze structure
- [x] Identify CSS file size (2845 lines) and major sections
- [x] Map out current architecture and dependencies

## Phase 2: Propose initial refactoring strategy ✅
- [x] Analyze CSS sections and categorize by functionality
- [x] Create proposed directory structure
- [x] Define first incremental step for extraction
- [x] Document rationale for each organizational decision

## Phase 3: Implement first modular extraction step
- [ ] Extract base styles (reset, typography, variables)
- [ ] Create initial directory structure
- [ ] Update imports in main App.css
- [ ] Ensure no functionality is broken

## Phase 4: Validate and test first step
- [ ] Test build process with Vite
- [ ] Verify all styles are loading correctly
- [ ] Check for any missing imports or broken styles

## Phase 5: Continue incremental refactoring
- [ ] Extract layout components (presentation controls, containers)
- [ ] Extract component-specific styles (buttons, cards, menus)
- [ ] Extract utility classes and animations
- [ ] Implement CSS modules where appropriate

## Phase 6: Final validation and delivery
- [ ] Complete build testing
- [ ] Document the new structure
- [ ] Provide migration guide
- [ ] Deliver refactored codebase
