# SlideBusinessCase Redesign Plan

## Goals
- Make the slide visually engaging, easy to scan, and persuasive for business/technical audiences.
- Use Above's brand colors, card layouts, and iconography.
- Reduce text density, use visual hierarchy, and group related content.
- Ensure mobile and desktop readability.

## Problems with Current Slide
- Too much dense text, especially in ICP cards.
- No clear visual separation between ICPs, metrics, objections, and summary.
- Lacks visual cues (icons, highlights, callouts) for key points.
- No summary or call-to-action at the top or bottom.
- Table is visually bland.

## Redesign Plan
1. **Header**
   - Add a short, bold summary tagline under the title.
   - Use a brand color background or highlight for the header.

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Use a large card with a brand accent border or background.
   - Add a key icon or illustration.
   - Use 2-3 short, bold sentences. Move details to a tooltip or expandable section if needed.

3. **ICP Personas**
   - Use a horizontal or vertical stepper/roadmap with icons for each ICP.
   - For each ICP, show:
     - Persona icon, title, and a one-line summary.
     - Tabs or expandable/collapsible sections for Environment, Pain, Value, Business Case, Budget.
     - Use badges or color highlights for key pain points and values.
   - Consider a 3-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile.

4. **Metrics Impact**
   - Use a visually engaging comparison table with icons (e.g., ‚è±Ô∏è, üëÅÔ∏è, üõ°Ô∏è).
   - Highlight the "After Above" column with a brand color.
   - Add a callout for the most impressive metric.

5. **Objections & Rebuttals**
   - Use a Q&A or chat bubble style, with icons for objection and rebuttal.
   - Highlight the most common objection.

6. **Final Positioning**
   - Use a large, bold card with a brand background or border.
   - Add a call-to-action or next step (e.g., "See a demo", "Contact us").

7. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure all cards and grids stack cleanly on mobile.

## Next Steps
- Redesign the JSX structure to match this plan.
- Update the CSS module for new layouts and highlights.
- Use icons and color for visual hierarchy.
- Test on desktop and mobile.
