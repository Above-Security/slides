# SlideBusinessCase Redesign: Systematic Plan & Premises

## Premises & Requirements
- **Audience:** CISO, Security Architect, IT Director, and business/technical decision makers in mid-market and enterprise SaaS-heavy organizations.
- **Language:** Clear, concise, business- and security-focused. Avoid marketing fluff. Use the language of risk, value, and operational impact.
- **Purpose:** This is a pitch deck slide, not a website or sales landing page. The goal is to persuade, inform, and make the business case for Above Security as a critical, missing layer in the modern SaaS security stack.
- **Brand Policy:**
  - Use Above's brand colors, typography, and card patterns (see `card-patterns.css`, `shared-slide-components.css`).
  - Avoid gradients in table headers unless specified in brand guidelines.
  - Use whitespace, clear hierarchy, and visual grouping for readability.
  - Use icons and color only to support clarity, not as decoration.
- **Design Principles:**
  - Minimize text density. Use bullets, callouts, and short, punchy statements.
  - Each card/section should have a clear purpose and visual separation.
  - Use a 2-column or grid layout for personas/ICPs, not 3+ on desktop, 1 on mobile.
  - FAQ/Objections should use a Q&A or card accordion style, not chat bubbles.
  - Table should be clean, with clear headers, minimal color, and highlight only the most important column ("After Above").
  - No sales CTAs (e.g., "See a Demo", "Contact Us"). End with a strong positioning statement or next-step relevant to a pitch deck (e.g., "Why Above is the last layer you need").
- **Content Framing:**
  - Executive summary: 2-3 sentences, bold, with a brand accent bar or icon.
  - ICPs: For each, show persona, 1-line summary, 2-3 key pains, 2-3 key Above values. Use cards with clear headers and whitespace.
  - Metrics: Table with 3-5 rows, highlight "After Above" column, use icons only if they add clarity.
  - Objections: Use a vertical list, each with a bold objection and a short, clear rebuttal. No chat bubbles or emojis unless brand allows.
  - Final Positioning: Large, bold, single card with a brand accent and a single, memorable statement.
- **CSS:**
  - Use or extend `card-patterns.css` and `shared-slide-components.css` for card and section styling.
  - Use `var(--brand-primary)`, `var(--surface-primary)`, `var(--surface-secondary)`, and other brand tokens for backgrounds and accents.
  - Responsive: 2-column grid for ICPs on desktop, 1-column on mobile. Table and cards should be readable on all devices.

## Next Steps
1. Redesign the JSX structure for clarity and brand alignment.
2. Refactor the CSS to use shared card patterns and remove gradients from table headers.
3. Rewrite the FAQ/Objections section to use a clean, readable card or list style.
4. Remove sales CTAs and end with a strong, relevant positioning statement.
5. Test for readability, clarity, and brand alignment on desktop and mobile.
