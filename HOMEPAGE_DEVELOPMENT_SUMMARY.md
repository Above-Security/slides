**Prevention**: SEO testing and monitoring setup

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Development Issues

#### 1. Router Not Working
```bash
# Symptoms: Routes not loading, 404 errors
# Solution: Check React Router DOM installation
npm install react-router-dom

# Verify router setup in App.jsx
# Ensure proper BrowserRouter wrapping
```

#### 2. Styling Not Applied
```bash
# Symptoms: Homepage looks unstyled
# Solution: Verify CSS import in HomePage.jsx
import './HomePage.css';

# Check CSS file path and naming
```

#### 3. Development Server Issues
```bash
# Symptoms: Server won't start or routes 404
# Solution: Restart development server
npm run dev

# Check Vite configuration for router support
```

#### 4. Build Errors
```bash
# Symptoms: Build fails with route errors
# Solution: Update vite.config.js if needed
# Ensure all imports are correct
```

### Production Deployment Issues

#### 1. Static Hosting Router Support
```bash
# Problem: Direct route access returns 404
# Solution: Configure server for SPA routing
# Add proper .htaccess or server config
```

#### 2. Asset Loading Issues
```bash
# Problem: CSS or images not loading on production
# Solution: Check base URL configuration
# Verify asset paths in build output
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Page Load Times**: Homepage vs Slides performance
